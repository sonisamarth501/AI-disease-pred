# AI Disease Prediction

This is a cutting-edge Tkinter based powered by machine learning, designed to accurately classify the disease based on several symptoms.

# Key Features
Data collection:
The system allows to save the uploaded data in static section in the directory for future usage and several predictions.
It fetches the several .csv datasets.

Data preprocessing:
The input data is preprocessed to handle missing values, normalize or scale features, and transform categorical variables.

Machine Learning Models:
Various machine learning algorithms are employed, including decision trees, random forests, support vector machines (SVM), and gradient boosting techniques, to build predictive models.

Prediction:
Based on the trained model, the system recommends correct predictions according to the given input parameter.

Model Training and Evaluation:
The models are trained on historical data and evaluated using appropriate performance metrics to ensure accuracy and reliability.

User-Friendly Interface:
The system provides a user-friendly interface where users can easily input their data, view recommendations, and explore additional information.

#Technology Used

Kaggle:
Enabling direct access to multiple datasets hosted on Kaggle. This integration simplifies the data retrieval process, making it convenient for users to tap into Kaggle's extensive collection of tech-related datasets.



Google colab:
Virtual notebook/plateform for training  classification model.

Python: Programming language used for model development, data preprocessing, and web application development. 

Tkinter:
Pyhon module for creating User Interfaces.



Scikit-learn: Machine learning library used for model training, evaluation, and prediction. Pandas: Data manipulation library used for data preprocessing and analysis. 

NumPy: Library for numerical computing used for handling arrays and mathematical operations.
